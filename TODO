# Bugs:

# Compiler bugs:
* #through in if-case statements

# Changing how cursors work:
## Pros of relative offsets
* Cursor edition is simpler (don't have to move cursors forward/backward when inserting/deleting)
* 

## Cons of relative offsets
* Have to calculate the absolute offset when needed (not that big of a deal since most likely you don't have thousands of cursors)
* Moving a single cursor means moving next cursors in the opposite direction
* Sorting is harder

## Pros of absolute offsets
* Never need to calculate relative offsets, and absolute offsets are stored as is
* Moving cursors is simpler

## Cons of absolute offsets
* Cursor edition is more complicated
